#This file contains some examples for Python Strings 
#What is Strings in python ?
#Strings are amongst the most popular types in Python.
#We can create them simply by enclosing characters in quotes. 
#Python treats single quotes the same as double quotes. 
#Creating strings is as simple as assigning a value to a variable.
