# Examples on how to uses python operators 
a = 20 ; b = 10

# Addition operator
c = a + b
print "Addition value =" , c

# Subtraction operator
c = a - b
print "Subtraction value = " , c

# Multipliction operator 
c = a * b
print "Multipliction value = " , c

# Division operator 
c = a / b
print "Division value = " , c

# Mod operator 
c = a % b
print "Mod value = " , c

# Exponent or power operator
a = 2 ; b = 3 
c = a ** b
print "Exponent value = " , c

# floor Division or integer division operator
'''
Note : 
In Python the division of 5 / 2 will return 2.5 this is floating point division 
the floor Division or integer divisio will return 2 mean return only the integer value 
'''
a = 9 ; b = 4 
c = a // b 
print "Integer Division value = " , c
